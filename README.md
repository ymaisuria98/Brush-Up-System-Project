The registration process involves visiting the system and clicking on the "Register" button to create an account. Users need to provide accurate information and answer security questions. After completing the registration, a unique ID is generated for each account, and users can log in using their credentials.

The homepage serves as the central hub of the system, providing access to various features and functionalities. Users can view and edit their profile information, including username, password, email, phone number, job title, and account ID. The profile page also allows users to hide or show their password for privacy.

Within the system, employees can create job reports by filling out fields such as customer name, customer address, report description, proposed cost, and estimated completion date. These reports help track job progress and ensure effective project management.

The system also enables users to view all job reports, search for specific reports, create invoices, view and search through invoices, and access sensitive account information (such as routing number, banking information, hourly rate, and social security number) for employees. However, it's important to note that employees can only view this sensitive information and cannot update or edit it.

For administrators, the admin section provides additional functionalities. The admin homepage serves as a dashboard to monitor system performance, view employee information, and edit employee details as needed. Performance reports offer insights into system usage and efficiency, enabling administrators to make informed decisions and improvements.
